I want to create an app through which you can find friends near you who have similar interests as you.

 This is the concept for that. 
 
 Currently, I'm thinking of it this way:
 
- Main Screen
 - Bottom Navigation Bar 
 with three options: - Match Me Page - Activities Page - Groups Page
 
 .On top, there would be your profile photo (on clicking which you can open the "my profile " page). 
 
 Also, there would be three lines to open extra settings.
 
Inside that Match Me page, there would be a function/feature through which you would be able to click a button and the matching algorithm would pair you up with two/three compatible people like you.
  
You can set up the settings of the matching under that Match Me button, such as: 
   
- Distance you want to use for matching (slider)
   
- Button to filter out if you're male, you can select 'male only' mode or 'anyone' 
    
- No female-only mode for males as this is a friendship app and not a dating app
    
- You would also be able to pick group size 
     
- You would also be able to pick the interests you want people of to be matched with on the activities page, anyone could be able to list activities (something like "looking for a badminton partner").
     
He would be able to state his location or where he wants it, and that activity would be shown only to people in that proximity. 
      
Those who are interested can chat with him in the comments by writing something or clicking "I'm interested." 
      
The other person who has listed the activity would be able to accept him after verifying his profile. On the groups page, you would be able to see the groups that you have created and your chats.


On the profile page, you would be able to update your profile photo etc. You would also be able to see your interests there would be a section for your interests personality a detailed view about like your profile and the activities that you have listed etc.
